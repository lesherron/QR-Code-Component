## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I'm continuing to practice HTML, CSS, and the box-shadow property to create a shadow effect around the QR code.

```css
.whiterect {
      background-color: white;
      width: 288px;
      height: 430px;
      border-radius: 10px;
      margin-left: 16px;
      margin-top: 16px;
      box-shadow: 0px 5px 10px 5px hsl(180, 1%, 74%);
    }
```

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable with CSS and learning advanced CSS techniques. Also, I need to get better using git respositories and how to leverage their power for my projects.
